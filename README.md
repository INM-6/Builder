# 🏗 Builder

Collection of tools and scripts to install software on a system.

In contrast to usual packaging systems, the aim is to equally help users *and*
admins. Many aspects are inspired by
[Portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Portage), which is used by the
[Gentoo](https://gentoo.org/) linux distribution.
